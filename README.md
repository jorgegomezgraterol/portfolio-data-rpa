# Data Analytics + RPA Portfolio

This repository will host my portfolio projects in **Data Analytics** (Excel, Power BI, SQL) and **Robotic Process Automation (RPA)** with **UiPath**.

## About me
I’m Jorge Gómez Graterol, an operations lead transitioning into data and automation. I’m building practical projects to demonstrate skills in data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and process automation. My goal is a fully remote role where I can combine **Power BI + SQL** with **UiPath** to deliver measurable impact.

## Focus areas (in progress)
- Data cleaning and EDA (Excel / SQL)
- Power BI data models and interactive dashboards
- UiPath bots for data collection, cleaning, and reporting

## Roadmap
- Superstore Sales Dashboard (Power BI)
- World Bank Data Exploration (Excel/SQL)
- NYC Transport Analysis (SQL + Power BI)
- UiPath Data Pipeline Bot (download → clean → load to PB)
- UiPath Web Scraper (pricing tracker)

## Tools
Excel · Power BI · SQL (PostgreSQL, SQLite) · UiPath · Git/GitHub
