📊 Data Analytics + 🤖 RPA Portfolio

This repository hosts my portfolio projects in Data Analytics (Excel, Power BI, SQL) and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) with UiPath.

👤 About Me

I’m Jorge Gómez Graterol, an operations lead managing 45+ people and now transitioning into data analytics and automation.
I’m building practical projects to demonstrate skills in data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and process automation.

💡 My goal: land a fully remote role where I can combine Power BI + SQL + UiPath to deliver measurable business impact.
